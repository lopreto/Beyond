# Beyond API

## Developer Considerations

* The `ITodoList` and `ITodoListRepository` interfaces are registered as singletons to keep values in memory during the application's lifetime. In a real-world scenario, they should be configured as transient or scoped depending on the requirements.

* Unit tests for the service are implemented only for the `AddItem` method as an example. In a production-ready application, all methods should be covered, although the aggregate already contains unit tests where the domain logic is applied.

* The PrintItems method only sorts the list, while rendering the data is delegated to the presentation layers (Console and Angular). This separation of concerns adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle.

## Running the project locally üöÄ

### To run the project:

1. Open the solution in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE  
2. Set `Beyond.Todo.Project.Console` o `Beyond.Todo.Project.WebApi` as the startup project  
3. Run the application (F5 or `dotnet run` if using CLI)

### Then open your browser at:
http://localhost:7269 or the port configured in `launchSettings.json`
